# Mail

This is a single page web app built using Javascript and a 3rd party API. The project does utilise Python and Django, however I only wrote the HTML, CSS and Javascript elements. Users must log in and have access to an inbox, sent and archive mailbox and also allows them to send emails to registered users. To accomplish this, Javascript is used to communicate with an API (not created by me) which will either store or retreive certain data based on the current page's requests. The site is a single page web app designed after the Gmail client. As this is a dynamic site, I don't have it hosted currently so please feel free to review the code or watch my video explanation. 

This was made as part of CS50's 2021 Web Development course.
